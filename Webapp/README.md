# AeroStream â€” Intelligent Disease Detection via Breath Analysis

AeroStream is a cloud-native platform for real-time breath analysis and disease detection, built with Next.js, Azure, Supabase, and LLMs. Designed for rural scalability, it supports secure patient-doctor workflows with OTP-based access.

---

## 1. How It Works

1. User logs in via phone number (Supabase + Twilio OTP)
2. Breath input is collected and processed client-side
3. Processed signal sent to Azure Function â†’ triggers LLM-based prompt analysis
4. Disease risk is inferred and shown on the User Dashboard
5. Notification sent to doctor dashboard if threshold is crossed

---

## 2. Features

- **Breath-Based Disease Prediction** using signal data and AI prompt engineering
- **Secure Auth with Supabase** and **SMS OTP with Twilio**
- **Mobile-First Frontend** built with Next.js and Shadcn for rapid access
- **Azure Cloud-Hosted Backend** for inference and data sync
- **Doctor Dashboard** for tracking patient diagnostics
- **Admin Panel** for managing trends, usage, and rural deployment

---

## 3. Motivation

> AeroStream is designed to bring **preventive health diagnostics** to underserved regions through low-cost, LLM-powered tools that operate on breath-based bio-signals. Breath contains detectable biomarkers for diseases such as **COVID-19, diabetes, lung disease, and even cancer**.
